## 🧠 How Scoring Works

- **Keywords** from the job description are matched in each CV
- **Date ranges** (e.g., `2016 - 2020`, `2018 to Present`) are parsed to calculate total experience
- Final score = **Keyword Relevance + Experience Weight**

> Example: 70% match with 4 years → Score = 70 + (4 * 5) = 90
